# Blacksmith UI kit

Blacksmith UI kit is a collection of high-level, opiniated, production-ready
React components for interacting with the [Blacksmith REST
API](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/http).

The goal is not to make a UI kit from scratch but instead leveraging
[Elastic UI](https://elastic.github.io/eui) for a better user experience.
It is primarly meant to be used by the [Blacksmith
Dashboard](https://github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith-dashboard).
The Blacksmith Dashboard enables organizations to have a complete view of their
data engineering solution.

We decided to make a clear separation of concerns between the components and the
built-in dashboard so one can easily create a custom one or customize the default
one by forking it. To make forks and customization as easy as possible, the
dashboard is available as an [open-source "template" repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith-dashboard).

The UI kit is composed of three levels of React components:

- **Scenes** are high-level components. They handle API requests, loading, and
errors so you don't have to. They are very powerful since all you need is a
single line of code to achieve a complex task.

- **Cards** are medium-level components. Some handle API requests, loading, and
errors while some others don't â€” it depends on the use case. They are used to
embed a single piece of information. Scenes may be made of one or multiple cards.

- **Atoms** are low-level components and are not meant be used outside scenes
and cards. Scenes and cards may be made of multiple atoms. Atoms are documented
and tested for internal use only.

Blacksmith UI kit can be installed as a JavaScript package using `npm`:
```bash
$ npm install @nunchistudio/blacksmith-eui
```

> This package follows the semantic versioning of Blacksmith for major and minor
  versions. For example, the UI kit `v0.18.x` will be compatible with Blacksmith
  `v0.18.x`.
