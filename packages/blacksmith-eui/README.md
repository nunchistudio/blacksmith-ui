# Blacksmith UI kit

Blacksmith UI kit is a collection of high-level, opiniated, production-ready
React components for interacting with the [Blacksmith REST
API](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/http).

The goal is not to make a UI kit from scratch but instead leveraging
[Elastic UI](https://elastic.github.io/eui) for a better user experience.
It is primarly meant to be used by the [Blacksmith
Dashboard](https://github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith-dashboard).
The Blacksmith Dashboard enables organizations to have a complete view of their
data engineering solution.
